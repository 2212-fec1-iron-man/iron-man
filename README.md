**Below the search bar is the question and answer list. Initially, the page will render four questions and two answers for each question, sorted by helpfulness. If there are more than two answers for a given question, a "load more answers" button will be activated to render two more answers until there are no more, at which point a "collapse" button will be displayed. The same functionality applies to the questions themselves.**
